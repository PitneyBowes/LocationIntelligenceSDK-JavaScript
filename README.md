# LocationIntelligenceSDK-JavaScript
### Description
LocationIntelligenceSDK-JavaScript facilitates you to build Web applications using Location Intelligence APIs.
### Getting Started
* To get started with JavaScript SDK, you must first register at [Location Intelligence API Home Page](http://developer.pitneybowes.com/en/location-intelligence.html) and obtain your API Key and Secret to get started with the JavaScript SDK and call Location Intelligence APIs.
 For more information refer to [‘Getting Started with JavaScript SDK’](https://locate.pitneybowes.com/docs/location-intelligence/v1/en/index.html#Java%20Script%20SDK/js_intro.html) section in documentation.
 
 We need to include following dependencies to start using LocationIntelligenceSDK-JavaScript 
 
 1. [jQuery 2.2.0](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.0.min.js) 
 2. [leaflet 1.0.0] (http://leafletjs.com/download.html)
 3. [tangram 0.9.5 ](https://github.com/tangrams/tangram)
 
  We have to include three yaml files for GeoMap vector tiles themes. The yaml files are steel.yaml,bronze.yaml and iron.yaml and are under lib folder on Git.
